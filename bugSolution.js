The solution is to always use the setter function provided by `useState` to update the state variable. Here's the corrected code:
```javascript
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  const incrementCount = () => {
    setCount(count + 1); // Correct way to update state
  };

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>{count}</Text>
      <Button title="Increment" onPress={incrementCount} />
    </View>
  );
}
```
By using `setCount(count + 1)`, the state is updated correctly, triggering a re-render of the component with the new value of `count`.
